\section{Introduction }\label{sec1}
Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) is a state-of-the-art imaging technique that uses diffraction from a coherent beam of light or electrons to reconstruct an image of a specimen without the need for optics. This microscopy technique is useful because it overcomes the lens aberrations of traditional lens-based imaging, thus allowing imaging at finer scales than previously possible. As a general approach CDI has found application in a broad range of settings, including nanoscale imaging through Bragg coherent diffractive imaging reconstruction (BCDI), X-ray ptychography, optical super-resolution, and astronomical wavefront sensing. \cite{dean2006phase, heintzmann2021answers, miao2015beyond}

The main challenge of CDI, known as the phase retrieval problem, originates from the fact that detectors only record the intensity (i.e., squared amplitude) of the diffracted wave, not its phase. The phase carries essential information about the illuminated real-space object, and its loss stops the direct calculation of an image from the recorded diffraction. A breakthrough development over two decades ago outlined an iterative approach to solve the inverse problem of phase retrieval and made CDI image reconstruction possible \cite{miao1999extending}. Unfortunately, these iterative algorithms are slow and typically computationally expensive \cite{epie}, which consequently precludes CDI in high-throughput or in situ settings, such as at x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). In addition, such methods often suffer from noise sensitivity and limitations in robustness.

A considerable body of literature focuses on applying deep learning (DL) to inverse problems, with significant success in employing neural networks (NNs) to solve the CDI phase problem much more rapidly than conventional iterative methods \cite{ratner2021recovering,yao2022autophasenn}. Early efforts utilized supervised learning to train these deep learning models and achieved several-orders of magnitude speed improvements, accompanied by two major drawbacks: degradation in reconstruction quality and the need for large volumes of high-quality labeled training data. More recently, strategies such as incorporating the diffraction forward map into deep learning models have been introduced to eliminate the requirement for labels. 
%These models are particularly appealing because they combine unsupervised training with reconstruction quality comparable to (or approaching) that of supervised methods.

Despite the promise of these developments, existing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for CDI have not explored physical priors or constraints beyond the diffraction forward map and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) sampling requirements, nor have they modeled any stochasticity of the relevant physics. Both these approaches introduce Inductive Biases in the learning algorithm \cite{mitchell1980need, baxter2000model}, enabling better generalization to test samples outside the explicit training set while also reducing the need for large corpora of training data. As an illustration, incorporation of physics based knowledge via hard constraints reduces the region in solution space to be explored and thus reduces the need for large training datasets \cite{baker2019workshop}. Similarly, incorporating uncertain or incomplete domain-specific knowledge via the use of probabilistic loss functions leads to improved convergence and generalizability \cite{baker2019workshop}. In this light, it is conceivable that incorporating additional physics information in the model architecture and developing principled probabilistic loss functions may enhance both accuracy as well as generalizability, while also maintaining the speed of prior supervised learning approaches. 

In this work, we develop the PINN computational approach to CDI, specifically for ptychographic reconstruction. Ptychography is defined as a conventional CDI technique with overlap, originally introduced to calculate the phase of Bragg reflections from crystals. It represents an amalgam between Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) and Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI). Ptychography utilizes convolutions in Fourier space between an object's diffraction pattern and the transform of the illumination function. This involves the measurement of manifold diffraction patterns via the scanning of an X-ray probe over the specimen, while using the overlap between adjacent illuminations for over-determination. In this light, it is often also referred to as scanning CDI. When coupled with reconstruction approaches, this leads to robust computational imaging. 

In this study, we integrate three novel elements for Machine Learning based approaches to ptychography: unsupervised training using the diffraction forward map, additional physics-based constraints informed by the ptychography setup, and an explicitly probabilistic treatment of photon counting (Poisson) statistics. We find that this unique combination of model features merges the advantages of a standard PINN approach, namely speed and unsupervised training, with significantly better reconstruction accuracy than other NN-based solvers, including physics-informed approaches.


\section{Methods, Models \& Tests}
\subsection{Approach}

Physics-based CDI reconstruction methods are accurate because they invert the physically correct forward map of far field diffraction, making them capable of finding the optimal solution, in principle, for any input. However, due to the difficult nonconvex optimization problem, these methods require computationally expensive iterative solution schemes. Additionally, iterative reconstruction is oblivious to regularities in the input data, so each new diffraction signal requires computation commencing from scratch. In contrast, NN-based reconstruction methods take a different approach: they may not incorporate domain knowledge of the diffraction physics but instead rely on a large amount of training data to fit a flexible black box model from scratch. The inductive biases introduced in the learning algorithm are chiefly from the choice of the model architecture. For instance, the use of convolutional and pooling layers renders the final model approximately translation invariant. The lack of domain knowledge-based inductive biases and physical consistency-enforcing constraints in conventional NN-based methods cause them to have reduced accuracy and generalization with respect to the underlying physics, although they may capture particular data regularities well. Additionally, conventional neural networks are trained via supervised learning approaches. Thus, they require large corpora of labeled data for training, and the limited diversity of the training data brings in bias. Nonetheless, the single forward pass nature of NN-based methods makes them intrinsically rapid at inference time.

From this perspective, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) attempt to unite the best of both worlds\footnote{Archetypal PINNs utilize a soft-constraint on the solution space by using the residual of the governing Partial Differential Equation as a regularization term. Our PINN model incorporates domain physics information in the architecture of the model.}. By strongly constraining a neural network model's hypothesis space to exclude parameter combinations that generate unphysical solutions, we can predispose a model towards physically correct solutions while also considerably reducing the need for training data. As a concrete starting point, defining the model's loss function over the forward-mapped (i.e., far field-diffracted) NN output -- instead of the immediate NN output -- forces the NN to learn diffraction physics rather than merely fit \emph{a priori} arbitrary input/output pairs. This is the foundation for prior PINN approaches for unsupervised CDI reconstruction \cite{yao2022autophasenn, ratner2021recovering}.

\subsubsection{Map formulation}
% TODO language, repetitive
With this background in place, we develop a new approach for ptychographic reconstruction based on a combination of NN layers, explicit constraints, and the forward map of far-field diffraction.

To begin, the reconstruction problem requires approximating a mapping $G: X \rightarrow Y$ from the diffraction/reciprocal-space domain $X$ to the real-space domain $Y$. Because we wish to avoid supervised training, we rely on an autoencoder formalism that composes $G$ with a second mapping $F: Y \rightarrow X$. The output of the autoencoder is then $\hat{x} = F(G(x))$, where $x$ is the (complex) diffracted wave field. \footnote{The measured diffraction intensity is therefore $I \appropto x^2 $.}

% TODO meeting - that rely wholly on a PINN loss
In prior PINN approaches to CDI reconstruction, $F$ is typically the forward map of far-field diffraction. Here, we instead start by subdividing $F$ into two parts: a \emph{constraint} map $ F_c: Y \rightarrow Y$ and a diffraction map $ F_d: Y \rightarrow X$, such that $F(Y) = F_d(F_c(Y))$. Because diffraction patterns are centrosymmetric even for a non-centrosymmetric object  $F_c$ imposes the real-space constraints derived from overlapping diffraction measurements to break the artificially imposed centrosymmetry and makes the inversion well-posed. $F$ may depend on parameters $\theta$ such as the experimental geometry, so we relate it to a functional $\mathbf{F}$, such that $F = \mathbf{F}(\theta)$.

In our concrete implementation the elements of a set of training samples $\{x_i\}$ have shape $64 \times 64 \times 4$, corresponding to four diffraction patterns measured at neighboring scan point coordinates. We denote a particular diffraction image with index $k$ $(k \in \mathcal{K} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$) as $x_i^k$. Each $x_i$ is paired with its matching 2D Euclidean probe coordinates, $r_i$ ($r_i \in \theta$). Correspondingly, the reconstruction $y_i = G(x_i)$ is a 3D tensor of shape $32 \times 32 \times 4$. (The factor-of-two difference in size between $x_i$ and $y_i$ satifies the oversampling requirement for invertibility of the discrete Fourier transform \cite{miao2000oversampling}). Finally, to distinguish between the two real-space representations we let $\bar{y}_i = F_c(y_i)$. We denote the amplitude and phase of $\bar{y}$ as $A$ and $\phi$, respectively, throughout this paper.

The inverse map $G$ consists of an encoder-decoder architecture with a similar structure to PtychoNN and $F_d$ is mostly defined by diffraction physics. The element of most interest is $F_c$, which we detail below.
% TODO language


\subsubsection{Real-space constraints}
% TODO language, constraints etc.
%The phase problem in coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) reconstruction presents as invariant diffraction amplitudes due to real-space object inversion and translation. In the case of scanning CDI, it's necessary to solve this problem using real-space constraints that leverage overlapping measurements.
In CDI reconstruction the phase problem manifests as invariances of the diffraction amplitude to coordinate inversion and translation of the real-space object. In the case of scanning CDI this must be solved using real-space constraints based on overlapping measurements.

In order to detail how the real-space constraint map, $\mathbf{F_c}(r_i)$, is applied to $y_i$, we can break it down into two steps. Initially, we sum the individual $y_i^k$ to create a unified reconstruction $\hat{y}_i$ with a shape of $64 \times 64$:
%
%We describe application of the real-space constraint map $\mathbf{F_c}(r_i)$ to $y_i$ in two steps. First, we sum the individual $y_i^k$ into a unified reconstruction $\hat{y}_i$ of shape $64 \times 64$:


\begin{equation} 
\hat{y}_i = \Sigma_{k \in \mathcal{K}} T(r_i^k - \mu_i, Pad2d(y_i^k))
\oslash
\Sigma_{k \in \mathcal{K}} T(r_i^k - \mu_i, Pad2d(\bf{1})), 
\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

where $Pad2d$ denotes zero-padding a $32 \times 32$ tensor to $64 \times 64$ and $T(\delta r, y)$ is the translation of a 2D tensor $y$ by the vector $\delta r$. $\mu_i$ is the origin of a local coordinate system for the group of scan points and is normally set to their centroid position, for convenience. $\oslash$ represents elementwise division, while $\bf{1}$ stands for a $32 \times 32$ tensor composed entirely of ones. Therefore, the divisor $\Sigma_{k \in \mathcal{K}} T(r_i^k - \mu_i, Pad2d(\bf{1}))$ has the role of a normalizing tensor.

The purpose of this first transformation is to construct a larger real-space image $\hat{y}_i$ that encompasses the entire solution region. The second, and arguably more critical, step implements translational symmetry of the reconstruction, factoring in shifts in the probe location. This step also transforms the 2D object $\hat{y}_i$ into a 3D object that matches the shape of the autoencoder output $x_i$, which is the required input format for $F_d$:

\begin{equation}
\bar{y}_i^k = T(\mu_i - r_i^k, \hat{y}_i) P(r) \approx O(r) P(r - r_i^k),
\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}

Here, $O(r)$ represents the ground-truth object, with the domain of its discrete approximation (right hand side) confined to a $32 \times 32$ patch centered at $r_i^k$.

% TODO
% \textcolor{red}{Apurva's Comments}

We can compare this approach to iterative scanning CDI reconstruction schemes, which enforce real-space constraints in a different way. In methods such as ePIE, the optimization loop is organized around alternating error corrections in real and reciprocal space. In the `backpropagation' step of ePIE, the error in diffraction reconstruction amplitude for one diffraction measurement -- equivalent to our our formulation's $\lvert x_i^k \rvert - \lvert \hat{x}_i^k \rvert $ -- induces an update of the $O(r)$ reconstruction via inverse DFT. In the training of PtychoPINN, errors from the $\vert \mathcal{K} \vert$ individual patterns are converted into model parameter updates instead of reconstruction updates, and this is done in parallel instead of sequentially.

%\textcolor{red}{In the context of this paper $\vert \mathcal{K} \vert$ = 4 always and there's no need to assign a variable to the set of scan point coordinates, but the model supports other solution grid sizes (i.e., K =  4 x 4, 6 x 6, etc.). the parallelism benefit of processing 4 patterns at a time is small, but at 16 and beyond it might start to matter. this should make PtychoPINN faster than the baseline NN method, but this is probably stuff for another paper.}


\subsubsection{Probabilistic output and loss function}
%\subsubsection{Loss function}

%The model loss is a simple MAE objective over reconstructed diffraction 
%
%$$
%Loss(\hat{x}, x) = \sum_{i,j,k}\log f_{\text{Poiss}}(I_{ijk};\lambda_{ijk})
%$$

We choose the model output to be a collection of independent Poisson distributions parameterized by the forward-mapping of the final-layer output of the NN. This reproduces the correct photon-counting statistics of the diffraction measurement and allows us to calculate a likelihood, with respect to the Poisson parameters, for the distribution of per-pixel detected photon counts. The negative log over these Poisson likelihoods is \emph{a priori} a more principled loss function than the typical choice of mean absolute average (MAE) deviation between target and predicted pixel values.

Explicitly, the loss function is

$$
Loss(x, \lambda(\hat{x})) = \sum_{i,j,k}\log f_{\text{Poiss}}(x_{ijk}^2;\lambda_{ijk})
$$


where $\lambda_{ijk}(\hat{x}) = \hat{x}_{ijk}^2$, $x_{ijk}^2$ is the number of photons detected in a single pixel (its square root $x_{ijk}$ is the associated target amplitude), $\lambda_{ijk}$ is the matching final-layer output of the CNN, $i$ and $j$ index the detector coordinates, and $k$ indexes separate images within a diffraction set. 

For the above probabilistic formulation of the data, model output, and loss function to be self-consistent it is necessary for the units of the diffraction pixel values to be (unscaled) photon counts. A typical diffraction intensity is $10^9$ photons per exposure whereas the magnitude of activations within the NN -- including, in particular, the reconstructed real-space amplitude -- should be of order unity. To invertibly scale the input (and output) we define a global normalization parameter that we initialize using a simple heuristic based on the mean photon count of images in the training dataset and unitarity property of the Fourier transform.   This normalization parameter can optionally be either fixed or optimized during training.

\subsection{PtychoPINN architecture}
% TODO equation for the normalization
With the approach now laid out, we introduce its implementation in the form of the deep learning framework PtychoPINN. As illustrated in Fig. \ref{diagram}, PtychoPINN uses an autoencoder architecture that incorporates 2D convolutional, average pooling, and upsampling layers in addition to custom layers that scale the network input (and output) and apply the constraint transformations (\ref{eq:1}) and (\ref{eq:2}). All convolutional layers use rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations, and as in the BCDI model AutophaseNN we incorporate sigmoid and tanh activations to limit the domain of the phase and amplitude of $\bar{y}_i$ to $[0, 2 \pi]$ and $[0, 1]$, respectively. \cite{yao2022autophasenn}

Representative samples of each dataset type are shown in Figure \ref{fig:datasets}, labeled respectively as Lines for randomly-oriented lines, GRF for Gaussian Random Field and `Large features' for the experimentally-derived data of \cite{cherukara2020ai}. \textcolor{red}{Note that these three categories of images are qualitatively different.  The first image (lines) is composed of highly asymmetric overlapping; whereas, the other two are composed more equiaxed features, one has fine-scale features and the other larger coarser features.  (Is there a better way to describe these?}\textcolor{blue}{In the caption I went with `sharpness' and `local symmetry' as the two distinguishing properties, not sure if that makes sense though} For each real-space object dataset we simulate a collection of diffraction patterns corresponding to a rectangular grid of scan points on the sample and a known (complex-valued) probe function. Given the real-space object $O(r)$ and far-field diffraction forward map $F_d$, the simulated diffraction pixel values are random samples from $f_{\text{Poiss}}(F_d(O(r))^2)$, where $f_{\text{Poiss}}$ is the Poisson distribution.

%For the generated or photographic images, each training dataset contains 49,284 diffraction patterns densely sampleed from 9 simulated objects. The experimental dataset is limited to a single object with 16,100 corresponding diffraction patterns. 
For all object types except `Large features', each training dataset contains 49,284 diffraction patterns densely sampled from 9 simulated objects. (The `Large features' dataset is limited to a single object with 16,100 diffraction patterns, corresponding to its smaller underlying experimental dataset.)

To train the model parameters we use the Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001.\cite{kingma2014adam} We train for 50 epochs and with a batch size of 16, which takes approximately 10 minutes on an Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU.

Figure \ref{fig:sim_comparison} presents a comparison of the reconstruction of artificially generated objects (from the `lines' data type of Fig. \ref{fig:datasets}) using PtychoPINN and the supervised learning baseline, PtychoNN. In these reconstructions, PtychoPINN demonstrates little noticeable degradation in the real-space amplitude and phase. In contrast, the supervised learning baseline shows substantial blurring. The 50 percent threshold of the amplitude Fourier ring correlation (FRC50), a useful measure of linear resolution, is $22.0~\mathrm{pixel}^{-1}$ for the baseline and a considerably improved $165.4~\mathrm{pixel}^{-1}$ for PtychoPINN. Furthermore, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), a standard metric for reconstruction quality in the super-resolution literature, is 13 dB higher for PtychoPINN. 

In order to explore the performance of the model across diverse data, we extended the evaluation to include two additional object types: those derived from Gaussian random field (GRF) generated objects and experimental measurements (Table \ref{tab1}).  For the current discussion please compare row-block 1 with 4. For each of the three image type, MAE metric for both phase and amplitude is significantly better for PtychoPINN with overlap than for baseline PtychoNN.  However, improvements in both PSNR and FRC50 were relatively modest for images with more equiaxed features compared to the improvements seen for the lines dataset. It should be noted, however, that the equiaxed image datasets have a smaller dynamic range and \textcolor{red}{more symmetric} features, which simplifies the reconstruction task.

Fig. \ref{fig:exp_comparison_detailed}, we see that both PtychoPINN and PtychoNN yield good amplitude reconstructions of the experimental object. Yet, the baseline's satisfactory amplitude reconstruction stands in contrast to its more limited recovery of the phase image (FRC50 of $93.7~\mathrm{pixel}^{-1}$ and $23.4~\mathrm{pixel}^{-1}$, respectively for PtychoPINN and baseline \textcolor{red}{I don't see these values in Table 1.}\textcolor{blue}{I will update values in the text to match the latest version of table 1. The issue before was that different PtychoNN training runs can produce very different reconstruction qualities. A solid 20 percent of runs are outliers. For more robust results, I've now done 8 runs for each model, removed the first and fourth quartile results for each run / model combination, and averaged the rest)}). While both methods have some difficulty reconstructing the phase in areas of the object with low scattering amplitude, PtychoPINN proves more robust; the baseline model, on the other hand, has a propensity to incorrectly invert the phase in these low-amplitude regions (Fig. \ref{fig:exp_comparison_detailed}(b)). \textcolor{red}{Why should a user care if the phase reconstruction is inadequate, as long as the final image reconstruction is good enough?  Does the poorer phase reconstruction affect the amplitude reconstruction? - Daniel's argument.}\textcolor{blue}{Wouldn't this depend on the sample - i.e. for certain objects (phase objects, like bio stuff), the phase reconstruction is more important than the amplitude reconstruction? Matt mentioned that for some of the nanoparticle samples they look at, the phase image has better constrast. I don't think we have a complete answer to the second question, though in some cases at least we're seeing the combination of bad phase reconstruction + good amplitude reconstruction. My understanding of Daniel's point was that uniform phase shifts (over the entire phase image reconstruction) don't matter -- and not necessarily that the phase image itself doesn't matter. }

\subsubsection{Ablation study}

To better understand the specific aspects of PtychoPINN architecture that contribute to its improved performance, we conducted an ablation study evaluating the impact of PINN-based training and real-space constraints. The comparison of reconstruction accuracy (MAE), resolution (Fourier ring correlation, FRC), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in Table \ref{tab1} suggests that the combination of overlap constraints and PINN structure is the most significant factor in improving performance. (\emph{Combination} is an important qualifier, as neither the PINN architecture nor the overlap constraints yields a substantial improvement in reconstruction accuracy when used individually.)
% TODO language, elaborate

\subsubsection{Out-of-sample generalization}
To complement these standard evaluation metrics we tested PtychoPINN's out-of-sample generalization. For this purpose, we extracted two distinct $392 \times 392$ patches from a larger image and used just one patch for training both the PtychoPINN model and the baseline model (Figure \ref{fig:gen_detailed}).

In order to provide a rigorous test of the models' out-of-sample performance, we intentionally selected two image patches with considerable divergence in their features. This choice of markedly different images creates a more stringent test of out-of-sample behavior than the other datasets that we have presented.

By comparing the models' reconstructions of the first (in-sample) and second (out-of-sample) patches, we can assess their out-of-sample generalizability. As depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:gen_detailed}, the comparison of panels (c) and (f) (representing PtychoPINN) to panels (b) and (e) (representing the baseline - PtychoNN - model) demonstrates a significantly smaller out-of-sample deterioration in reconstruction quality for PtychoPINN, which suggests that our proposed model exhibits improved generalizability compared to the baseline. The respective numerical comparison (Table \ref{tab2}) supports this assertion. Although both approaches, not surprisingly, perform less well on out-of-sample reconstructions, and the performance loss is more dramatic in FRC50 (resolution) metric then in PSNR metric, PtychoPINN performs significantly better (nearly two-fold better on FRC50) than the baseline model. 
%By examining each model's reconstruction of the first (in-sample) and second (out-of-sample) patches we can qualitatively judge the two models' out-of-sample generalization. The comparison of Fig. \ref{fig:gen_detailed} (c) and (f) (ours) to Fig. \ref{fig:gen_detailed} (b) and (e) (baseline) shows a much smaller out-of-sample degradation in reconstruction quality for PtychoPINN.

While the basic PINN and PtychoPINN both recover recognizable line features, PtychoNN produces objects that are quasi-reproductions of the GRF morphology, with no recovery of details smaller than the probe dimension. 

\subsection{Discussion}
In summary, we present an unsupervised learning approach for scanning coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) that integrates real-space constraints with a physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture (PtychoPINN) to yields substantial improvements in reconstruction accuracy and resolution while preserving the inherent speed of the previous NN-based approaches. 

%\emph{outline of transition paragraph}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The main purpose of this transition is to introduce the notion that we're going to present a perspective of the model that emphasizes model properties that a domain scientist looking to put the model to practical use would be interested in. 
%\item For each of these properties, we will also try to understand \emph{why} the model has that property, from the point of an ML person interested in the underlying mechanics. 
%\item The properties are: unsupervised trainning, generalization,  and resolution / accuracy.
%\end{itemize}

In the ensuing discussion, our primary objective is to highlight features of PtychoPINN  that would be most important to a domain scientist intending to deploy it for applications. When possible, we will also take the perspective of a machine-learning researcher to understand \emph{why} PtychoPINN exhibits these characteristics. We specifically concentrate on three essential attributes: unsupervised training, generalizability, and the interplay between resolution and accuracy.

\subsubsection{Unsupervised training} 
Unsupervised training provides three critical advantages over supervised learning methods for experimental deployment. The requirement of labeled data forces an experimenter to acquire several ptychographic datasets AND reconstruct the real-space image through iterative methods, before a faster NN-based method can be deployed.  The need for labeled training data also hinders on-the- fly retraining and update of the model. The resulting ability to train on a corpus of training samples drawn from a similar distribution as the test-time samples curtails the risks of any problems in out-of-distribution generalization that a model might suffer from. These advantages are particularly valuable in real-time experimental settings.  Finally, diversity of images types in the labeled training data introduces bias, and makes the model less robust.  This drawback is addressed further below.

PtychoPINN architecture has another inherent advantage: superior generalizability. Even a basic PINN, stripped of overlap constraints, exhibits superior out-of-sample generalization compared to the supervised learning baseline, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:gen}. This advantage becomes more pronounced when comparing generalizability of the full PtychoPINN with that of the latter, as in Figure \ref{fig:gen_detailed}. \textcolor{red}{We should say how an experimenter benefits from this - that is our primary goal in this exposition.}
% \textcolor{red}{sentence here on the second generalization study, fig. \ref{fig:gen_detailed}}

We attribute PtychoPINN's superior generalizability to the PINN structure, which necessitates the inverse map $G(X)$ to learn diffraction physics through its connection to the far-field diffraction map $F_d$ and diffraction-space loss function $L$. This connection enforces an approximation of physical consistency between the real-space reconstruction and the measured diffraction. Conversely, supervised training typically leads to violations of even basic conservation rules, such as the FT's unitarity (i.e., $\lVert x \rVert \approx \lVert F_c(G(x)) \rVert = \lVert F_d(\bar{y}) \rVert = \lVert \hat{x} \rVert$, by Parseval's identity and $\bar{y} \equiv F_c(G(x))$). \textcolor{red}{I wonder how much is the difference between ground truth and PtychoPINN for out-of-sample comes from limited Q range and high Q noise.  Would ePIE do better?}

Furthermore, given that $\hat{x} = F_d(\bar{y})$ is not bijective and the loss function does not directly rely on $\bar{y}$, the PINN structure inherently overlooks variations in real-space structure that the diffraction measurement can't discern. Conversely, supervised training is susceptible to wasting model capacity by memorizing the training data's real-space structure. All told, supervised learning approaches face challenges in generalizability due to the difficult task of reconstructing an \emph{a priori} arbitrary map $X \rightarrow Y$ with less guidance by useful inductive biases.

% Moreover, since $\hat{x} = F_d(\bar{y})$ is not a bijection and the loss function does not directly depend on $\bar{y}$, the PINN structure inherently disregards differences in real-space structure that are undetectable in the diffraction measurement. Conversely, supervised training is susceptible to wasting model capacity by memorizing the training data's real-space structure. All told, supervised learning approaches face challenges in generalization due to the difficult task of reconstructing an \emph{a priori} arbitrary map $X \rightarrow \hat{Y}$ with less guidance by useful inductive biases.

\subsubsection{Resolution and Accuracy}

    \caption{Comparison of real-space and diffraction reconstructions from PtychoPINN and the simple PINN with no overlap constraints.}%
    \label{fig:patches}
\end{figure}

 The advances in reconstruction quality presented by PtychoPINN hold two-fold significance: they bear practical implications for scientific applications, and also offer potential insights into the workings of the model itself. To facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the model, we distinguish between the concepts of \emph{resolution} and \emph{accuracy}.

Resolution, while a critical component of good reconstruction, is not sufficient. By comparing $32 \times 32$ reconstruction patches from PtychoPINN, PtychoNN, and a basic PINN (Figure \ref{fig:gen})\textcolor{red}{Is Fig. 7 needed?  Wouldn't this be visible in Fig. 5 if we an additional panel with ptychopinn reconstruction?}\textcolor{blue}{partially done - added a panel to Fig. 5. Unsure how to make this particular argument using Fig. 5 instead of Fig. 7, waiting until after we discuss before touching the text.}, we observe that the basic PINN's reconstruction of line features displays a sharpness on par with PtychoPINN's. However, in contrast to both PtychoNN and PtychoPINN, the basic PINN misplaces these features. This arises due to the far field diffraction forward map's invariance to coordinate inversion.  In other words, real-space objects $O(r)$ and $O(-r)$ yield identical diffraction amplitudes. Thus, the basic PINN fails to distinguish between reconstruction pairs that are mirror images, or chiral, to each other.


%The term `resolution', as used in this context, specifically refers to the former. Local resolution pertains to the detail and sharpness within individual reconstruction patches while overall, global resolution -- which we call accuracy -- refers to the reconstruction of features across the entire stitched-together image. Accuracy (i.e. global resolution) requires correct $O(r) / O(-r)$ parity within individual reconstruction patches, a more stringent condition.

% \footnote{It might be worthwhile to make a distinction between local resolution - resolution within a single solution region - and the overall resolution in an image that has been composed from multiple reconstruction patches. The term 'resolution', as used in this context, specifically refers to the former.

% Local resolution pertains to the detail and sharpness within individual reconstruction patches, while overall resolution \textcolor{red}{- are we calling this accuracy? - }refers to the reconstruction of features across the entire stitched-together image. The latter requires correct $O(r) / O(-r)$ parity within individual reconstruction patches, a more stringent condition.}

It is worthwhile here to make a distinction between local resolution - resolution within a single solution region - and overall resolution in an image that has been composed from multiple reconstruction patches. Local resolution pertains to the detail and sharpness within individual reconstruction patches, while reconstruction accuracy pertains to the entire stitched-together image. The latter requires correct $O(r) / O(-r)$ parity within individual reconstruction patches, a more stringent condition.The PINN architecture undoubtedly contributes a substantial enhancement to resolution, but it doesn't correspondingly boost \emph{accuracy}. The inclusion of real-space overlap constraints in PtychoPINN is needed to overcomes the degeneracy linked with pairs of coordinate inversion-equivalent candidate objects, and leads to PtychoPINN's large enhancement in the accuracy of reconstruction.  However, it's worth emphasizing that this improvement primarily comes from the correct alignment of high-spatial frequency features, and not from an increase in the amount of information underlying individual images.% why 'individual'?


% Discussion outline (from before we changed the structure of this section)
% \emph{Outline of the rest of the results / discussion section:}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Introduce the idea that we want to understand the source of PtychoPINN's improvements, and our method for doing so is to do an ablation study, which isolates the contribution of each model property to its performance, and also captures the effects of interactions between different model properties. 
% \item Compare PtychoNN, PtychoNN + overlap, PtychoPINN + MAE, PtychoPINN + NLL, PtychoPINN + no overlap on simulated data. Refer to a comparison of reconstruction images (Fig. \ref{fig:sim_comparison}) and the comparison table \ref{tab1}
% \item The above numerical experiments show that the main improvements in reconstruction accuracy come from the PINN architecture and ptychographic overlaps. The NLL loss function is also important because it improves the model's robustness, but this is not obvious based on the ablation study alone. We will add an extra figure to the supplemental materials that shows how / why this is true.

% \emph{Now we start the actual discussion portion.}

% \emph{Challenges of CDI reconstruction}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Slow speed of iterative solvers (makes real-time / in situ use impossible)
% \item NN gives speed at the expense of resolution, need for labels
% \end{itemize}

% \emph{Advantages/opportunities of autoencoder / PINN}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Retains speed of vanilla NN approach
% \item No need for labels.
% \item Proper DFT sampling conditions can be enforced (specifically, oversampling / zero-padding requirement)
% \item Solution space and hypothesis space are both reduced, allowing better generalization with smaller training set sizes
% \item NN approach learns details of images,
% \item PINN approach learns diffraction physics.
% \end{itemize}

% \emph{Advantages of overlap:}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Makes the inverse problem well-posed (i.e., solves the symmetry degeneracy issue of PtychoNN and vanilla PINN. By propagating model loss gradients through overlapping probe illumination regions, we parallel ePIE’s backwards-propagation of reciprocal space amplitude residuals into into real space updates of the object reconstruction.)
% \item Will enable handling of position jitter correction and using sub-pixel shifts to improve resolution (i.e., super-resolution)
% \item Improves reconstruction quality by averaging uncorrelated noise over multiple measurements
% \end{itemize}

% \emph{Advantages of the Poisson NLL as the objective:}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Gives appropriate weight to high-q portion of the diffraction signal, which improves resolution
% \item NLL is a Proper Scoring Rule; means Predicted distribution converges to actual, i.e., we fit underlying lambdas of the Poisson distribution, which is exactly what we want.
% \item Faster convergence, better stability in numerical experiments
% \item Enables future quantification of aleatoric uncertainties. 
% \item Poisson output is an accurate reflection of underlying physics.
% \item Increases robustness to shot noise.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, PtychoPINN combines the benefits of a PINN autoencoder formalism with those of physics-informed constraints to produce a method that dramatically enhances the reconstruction speed in comparison to iterative methods and offers significantly improved accuracy, resolution and generalizability compared to existing deep learning-based approaches to lensless imaging.  Furthermore, no requirement for labeled data and the ability to retrain the model on-the-fly provides a practical tool to an experimenter to image a complex object at resolution unattainable with lens in nearly real-time. 

 Additionally, the role of loss function in our model warrants exploration, as preliminary studies indicate that it contributes markedly to the reconstruction quality in photon-limited scenarios. This raises the significance of an appropriate choice of loss function, not only for psychographic reconstruction, but in deep learning approaches in general, especially those that aim to incorporate physical principles. Experimental uncertainties, such as probe and stage jitter, also degrade reconstruction quality. Integration of probabilistic approaches to reconstruction both further increase the reconstruction quality and lay a foundation for extraction realistic model uncertainty that can guide an experimenter to appropriate additional measurements and even modification of data collection geometry to achieve even higher quality reconstructions.

% \item The underlying manifold on which solutions live is smaller than the 64 x 64 output size ( oversampling requirement). Unsupervised models that are aware of this (e.g. AutophaseNN, PtychoPINN) thus have an output space of the correct (i.e. smaller) size. This may in part explain the PINN's better generalization / performance even in the absence of overlap information. We haven't mentioned this in the text, could go under Discussion / generalization.
